	Long: `

Nazare is a set of libraries and a server for probabilistic counters and sets.

This command line embeds the libraries and provide a way to store and fetch this data locally, without the need of a server

nazare-cli serverless local HLLCounters and Sets
Use -b </path/to/databasename.db> to persist w/ badgedb (default name nazare.db in the current dir)

HyperLogLog based counters:
Add to a hll counter: nazare-cli -c -a <countername> <item>
Estimate counter size: nazare-cli -c -e <countername>

Cuckoo filter based sets:
Add to a set: nazare-cli -s -a <setname> <item>
Check if an item belongs to a set: nazare-cli -s -i <setname> <item>
Remove an item from a set: nazare-cli -s -r <setname> <item>
Estimate set cardinality: nazare-cli -s -c <setname>
That's it, no way to get an item from a set, cuckoo filter stores hashes and signal it an item was 'seen'

K/V handling:
Set a key: nazare-cli -k -s <keyname> <value>
Get the value of a key: nazare-cli -k -g <keyname>
Delete a key: nazare-cli -k -d <keyname>
